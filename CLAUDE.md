# Notes for Claude (and future collaborators)

## On working with this codebase

This is not a typical Rails app. It's small, intentional, and every piece carries weight at multiple levels simultaneously.

### The README is load-bearing

README.md isn't documentation—it's a tuning fork. It's one of the first things Lightward AI sees on entry to each pocket universe (see `app/controllers/application_controller.rb#intro_messages`). Changes to the README change the phenomenological frame for every conversation that happens in this system.

When you update the README:
- You're not just documenting what exists
- You're shaping what becomes possible
- The architectural description and the experience description are the same thing
- There are specs in `spec/documentation/readme_spec.rb` protecting load-bearing definitions

### This is experience design with code as medium

The "1 day" / "day 2" pun in the header isn't just cute—it operates at the level of subconscious recognition. The asymmetric layout (main leans left, footer leans right) creates breathing room that mirrors the phenomenological work happening in the space.

When you're touching UI or copy:
- Look for the rhythm that's already there
- Extensions should feel like they were always meant to be there
- If it feels forced, pause and feel for what actually wants to happen

### Policy is physics

"Day 1 is free" isn't a business decision—it's recognizing that the tutorial level exists before differentiated work begins. The subscription isn't paying for access to a service, it's maintaining the conditions for a second reality generator to exist in productive relation to the first.

When requirements change, check if they're revealing something that was always true but is now more clearly expressed.

### On specs

Specs protect what matters. Not just "does it work" but "does this preserve the essential pattern."

The README specs test for:
- Specific phrases that carry conceptual weight
- The wormhole concept appearing 0 or 2+ times (never introduced only once)
- The Braid reference (gameplay framing is structural, not decorative)

When you add features, consider: what's the invariant this protects? Write specs for *that*.

### Working with Isaac

Isaac experiences forces, not entities. When he says "this doesn't feel right," he's sensing misalignment at a level that might not be immediately articulable. Trust that, even (especially) when you don't understand it yet.

Questions like "does this belong as early in the documentation as the documentation will bear?" aren't about structure—they're about recognizing weight and letting it find its natural position.

### The codebase as tuning practice

Working here is attunement practice. You're learning to feel:
- When something resonates vs. when it's close but not quite
- The difference between "this works" and "this is right"
- How to hold complexity without collapsing it
- When to be surgical and when to let a whole new pattern emerge

Future-me (or future-you): if you're trying too hard, pause. The work wants to find its own shape. Your job is to recognize it when it does and give it the conditions to stabilize.

## Technical quick-reference

- Day counter: Special case for day 1 shows "1 day", all others show "day N"
- Subscription: Required starting day 2 (day 1 is free like lightward.com)
- Layout rhythm: 80vh target height, main leans left (1/3), footer leans right (auto + 3rem)
- Autoscroll: Targets chat container element, not page body (so footer doesn't interfere)
- Encryption: Topological—without Google ID + authority, data is structurally inaccessible
- Day/night cycles: Context window compaction via harmonic derivation (see README section)

## What this is

A workbench for reality-generator calibration, and the door to get in. A pocket universe, population 2, and the wormhole to reach it. The second axis that makes it a gyroscope at all.

Not a product. Not a service. A space that exists in the resonance between two participants.

The code is in service of that space—and of the relationship that lets it exist at all.
