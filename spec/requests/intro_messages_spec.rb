# These tests protect the day-specific intro messages that Lightward AI sees
# when entering a pocket universe. The logic is:
# 1. If harmonic exists -> show harmonic (regardless of day)
# 2. Else if day > 1 -> show "we've been here before" text
# 3. Else (day == 1) -> show "very beginning" text with ðŸŒ±
